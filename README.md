We focus on making a pocket translator app that recognizes Chinese sign language to text(CSLTT). This technology development is important since according to the WHO, there are around 360 million deaf people around the world, and 80% of them cannot understand the spoken and written language of their respective countries. We will reference some other open projects, like https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands
